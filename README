           },
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple HTTPD for serving simple web application
    interfaces. It's completly event based and independend from any event
    loop by using the AnyEvent module.

    It's HTTP implementation is a bit hacky, so before using this module
    make sure it works for you and the expected deployment. Feel free to
    improve the HTTP support and send in patches!

    The documentation is currently only the source code, but next versions
    of this module will be better documented hopefully. See also the
    "samples/" directory in the AnyEvent::HTTPD distribution for basic
    starting points.

    AnyEvent::HTTPD even comes with some basic AJAX framework/helper.

FEATURES
    *   support for GET and POST requests

    *   processing of "x-www-form-urlencoded" and "multipart/form-data"
        encoded form parameters

    *   ajax helper and javascript output functions in
        AnyEvent::HTTPD::Appgets

    *   support for chunked encoding output to the HTTP client

METHODS
    The AnyEvent::HTTPD class inherits directly from
    AnyEvent::HTTPD::HTTPServer which inherits the event callback interface
    from Object::Event.

    Event callbacks can be registered via the Object::Event API (see the
    documentation of Object::Event for details).

    For a list of available events see below in the *EVENTS* section.

    new (%args)
        This is the constructor for a AnyEvent::HTTPD object. The %args hash
        may contain one of these key/value pairs:

        port => $port
            The TCP port the HTTP server will listen on.

EVENTS
    Every request goes to a specific URL. After a (GET or POST) request is
    received the URL is split at the '/' characters and joined again with
    '_' characters. After that the event with the name of the converted URL
    is invoked, this means that if you get a request to the url '/test/bla'
    the even "_test_bla" is emitted, you can register a callback for that
    URL like this:

       $httpd->reg_cb (
          _test_bla => sub {
             my ($httpd, $req) = @_;

             $req->respond ([200, 'ok', { 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' }, '<h1>Test</h1>' }]);
          }
       );

    The first argument to such a callback is always the AnyEvent::HTTPD
    object itself. The second argument ($req) is the
    AnyEvent::HTTPD::Request object for this request. It can be used to get
    the (possible) form parameters for this request or the transmitted
    content and respond to the request.

    Also every request also emits the "request" event, with the same
    arguments and semantics, you can use this to implement your own request
    multiplexing.

CACHING
    Any response from the HTTP server will have "Cache-Control" set to
    "max-age=0" and also the "Expires" header set to the "Date" header.
    Meaning: Caching is disabled.

    If you need caching or would like to have it you can send me a mail or
    even better: a patch :)
